### Howdy! ðŸ¤ 

I'm Jared Jewell (he/him/his), and I'm an aspiring web developer. I love learning, and making toy example projects to better understand new concepts and technologies. Please feel free to take a gander at any of my repo'sâ€”I'd love to have a fresh set of eyes on my work.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some personal projects, as well as my portfolio website.
- ðŸŒ± At the moment, I'm learning how to structure full-stack applications.
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm happy to collaborate on anything and everything!!
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with implementing secure user authentication & validation.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my Vim configuration!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm an adrenaline junkie! I love skiing and mountain biking.

Thanks for stopping by. Have a wonderful day!!
